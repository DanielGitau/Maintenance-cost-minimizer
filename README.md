k involved developing a data analysis tool in Python to guide maintenance decision making for machines based on historical reliability and maintenance data. The tool was required to provide Kaplan-Meier estimates of the reliability function, an estimate of a Weibull reliability function, MTBF, mean cost per unit time of an age-based maintenance policy, and mean cost per unit time of a condition-based maintenance policy based on simulation. 
The tool was also required to be able to analyse any dataset that followed the same structure as the given dataset. Additionally, a managerial summary was to be written based on the insights gained from the tool, including descriptives of the machines, the suggested maintenance strategy for each machine, the optimal maintenance age for each machine, the optimal maintenance threshold for the third machine, and the percentage cost savings achievable through the optimal maintenance policies in comparison to a pure corrective maintenance policy. 
The tool and the managerial summary were the deliverables for the task.
